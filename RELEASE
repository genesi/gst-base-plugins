Release notes for GStreamer Base Plug-insÂ 0.10.30 "Difficult Birth"
        


The GStreamer team is proud to announce a new release
in the 0.10.x stable series of the
GStreamer Base Plug-ins.


The 0.10.x series is a stable series targeted at end users.
It is not API or ABI compatible with the stable 0.8.x series.
It is, however, parallel installable with the 0.8.x series.



This module contains a set of reference plugins, base classes for other
plugins, and helper libraries.

This module is kept up-to-date together with the core developments.  Element
writers should look at the elements in this module as a reference for
their development.

This module contains elements for, among others:

  device plugins: x(v)imagesink, alsa, v4lsrc, cdparanoia
  containers: ogg
  codecs: vorbis, theora
  text: textoverlay, subparse
  sources: audiotestsrc, videotestsrc, gnomevfssrc, giosrc, appsrc
  network: tcp
  typefind functions
  audio processing: audioconvert, adder, audiorate, audioresample, volume
  visualisation: libvisual
  video processing: ffmpegcolorspace
  aggregate elements: uridecodebin, playbin2, decodebin2, decodebin, playbin


Other modules containing plug-ins are:


gst-plugins-good
contains a set of well-supported plug-ins under our preferred license
gst-plugins-ugly
contains a set of well-supported plug-ins, but might pose problems for
    distributors
gst-plugins-bad
contains a set of less supported plug-ins that haven't passed the
    rigorous quality testing we expect



  

Features of this release
    
      * Use Orc (Optimized Inner Loops Runtime Compiler) for SIMD and
        other optimisations, and remove liboil dependency. The main goal
        for this release was to make the transition from liboil to liborc.
        Performance improvements should not be expected and will be the
        focus of future versions. liborc is an optional dependency for
        the time being, to make it possible to test and develop the very
        latest GStreamer versions on systems that don't have orc yet.
        However, without orc slow unoptimised backup code will be used
        for many performance critical code paths. Distributors are urged
        to package and ship the latest version of liborc and compile
        GStreamer modules with --enable-orc. Please do not distribute
        GStreamer packages that are not orc enabled. More information on
        the orc integration can be found in the docs/design/ directory.
